# p02-bank

A simulation of a bank, as a simple design where a Bank struct can have a list of Account structs, with some functionality for each, such as 'create new', 'add to balance', 'deduct from balance', 'show balance', etc.

The example is kept simple because it will be used to show important topics about Rust's Ownership and Borrowing features.

**main.self-completed-version.rs** is for the attempt I made at finishing off the project functionality, after seeing the videos that explain ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, but **_before_** having seen the videos that show the guide's final implementation.

**main.rs** is the final version with any additional changes made that were done **_after_** seeing the rest of the guide's implementation.
