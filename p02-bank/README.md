# p02-bank

A simulation of a bank, as a simple design where a Bank struct can have a list of Account structs, with some functionality for each, such as 'create new', 'add to balance', 'deduct from balance', 'show balance', etc.

The example is kept simple because it will be used to show important topics about Rust's Ownership and Borrowing features.
