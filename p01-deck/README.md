# p01-deck

A data object made to represent a deck of cards, done to give examples of basics in Rust such as Structs, String Formatting, Struct Attributes, Vectors and Arrays, Inherent Implementation, and others.

When the project was completed, comments were cleaned up in the final main.rs, but main.verbosecomment.rs was made with intentionally verbose comments left in for explaining and reminding of details about the code as they were being introduced by the instructor.
